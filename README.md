# forecast-CIR_Kalman
Forecast of LIBOR via CIR modeling and Kalman estimation of the coefficients

1. Reference Paper: https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_22193_en.pdf
2. Data: CSV file of monthly LIBOR (tenors 1M-30Y) from 3/31/1998 until 04/30/2018
3. Data: CSV file of daily LIBOR (tenors 1M-30Y) from 04/24/2017 until 04/24/2018

TODO:
* Python code for the forecast (most likely employing pykalman)
